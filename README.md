# ml-monolith-to-microservices

This repository contains the replication package for our paper "A Pattern-Driven and LLM-Assisted Approach for Decomposing Monolithic ML-Based Systems into Microservices." It includes the full implementation of our methodology, datasets, code classification prompts, semantic clustering pipeline, and evaluation scripts. Our approach combines architectural design patterns, prompt-engineered large language models (LLMs), and unsupervised clustering to identify and restructure AI-centric components into modular microservices.
